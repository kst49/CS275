The website gets the user's current geolocation which can be passed to the Aeris Weather webservice
to obtain the most recent 7 day forcast for the provided geolocation.

The user opens the html file using the default webbrowser. Then, enters his/her clientId and password 
(if not my clientId and password will be used) and hits the display button. The user
gets a prompt asking if the website can access to the user's location. If the user 
clicks yes, a table that contains 7 days forcast of the minTemp, maxTemp, avgTemp, 
humidity of the current location will be displayed.
